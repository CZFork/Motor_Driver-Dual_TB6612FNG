[*SPARKFUN MOTOR DRIVER - DUAL TB6612FNG (1A) (ROB-09457)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9457)

The TB6612FNG motor driver can control up to two DC motors at a constant current of 1.2A (3.2A peak). 
Two input signals (IN1 and IN2) can be used to control the motor in one of four function modes - CW, CCW, short-brake, and stop. 
The two motor outputs (A and B) can be separately controlled, the speed of each motor is controlled via a PWM input signal with a frequency up to 100kHz. 
The STBY pin should be pulled high to take the motor out of standby mode.
